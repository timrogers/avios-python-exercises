# 2. Functions

1. Go back to [last week's exercise](../1_syntax/README.md) and rewrite your solution as a function, passing in your name, age and address as "positional arguments". 

2. Write a function, `square()`, which takes a number as a "keyword argument", and squares it. Set the default value of the argument to 2. Use that function to print 2 squared and 4 squared.

3. Take your function `square()`, and rewrite it with the name `powers()`, this time returning two values: the original number squared, and the original number cubed. Use that function to print the value for 5 squared and 5 cubed.
