# Avios Python exercises

This repository contains additional exercises for the Python workshops being run at Avios, following Codeacademy's ["Learn Python"](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python) course.

The exercises align with chapters of the course. For example, the `1_python_syntax` directory contains an exercise for Chapter 1, "Python Syntax".

In each directory is a description of what your code should do, example output (what you should see when you run your code) and a complete solution (no peeking!).

You can safely ignore the `.circleci` directory.

## Contributing

You can install the dependencies locally by running `pip install --user -r requirements.txt`.

You can check for code style issues by running `pycodestyle **/*.py`. Many issues
can be automatically fixed by running `autopep8 --in-place --aggressive **/*.py`.

When changes are pushed to Git, CircleCI will run and check the validity and style of the code samples.
