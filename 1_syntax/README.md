# 1. Syntax

Write a simple Python programme which prints:

* your name
* your age
* how many days old you were on your last birthday
* how many years old you were 1000 days ago (*hint*: you'll need to use brackets, like you would in real maths, for this one)
* your address (over multiple lines ðŸ¤”).

You should assign each step to a variable as you go.

The output of your programme should look something like this:

```
My name is Tim Rogers and I am 25 years old (that's 9125 days). 1000 days ago, I was 22 years old. My address is: WeWork,
38 Chancery Lane,
London,
WC2A 1EN
```
